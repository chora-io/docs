# Introduction

The [data module](https://chora.io/mods/data) interface enables users to interact with the data module.

## Overview

This guide will walk through the data module using the [data module](https://chora.io/mods/data) interface. In this guide, you will learn about the following:

1. Anchoring Data
2. Attesting to Data
3. Registering Data

## Prerequisites

### Keplr

You will need to have [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/download) installed as a browser extension on your desktop computer.

### Account

You will need to have a test account that you can use with `chora-testnet-1`. This account should not be generated from the same mnemonic or private key as an account that holds any tokens of real value or has any sensitive permissions on another network.

### Tokens

You will need to have testnet tokens available in your test account. You can use the [testnet faucet](https://chora.io/faucet) to receive tokens. The faucet only works if your balance is less than the distribution amount. You can request tokens from the faucet up to three times with the same account.
