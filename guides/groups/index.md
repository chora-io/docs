# Introduction

[Chora Groups](https://groups.chora.io) is a governance workspace where groups of individuals (or groups of groups) make decisions and manage shared resources.

Chora Groups leverages a dynamic group framework to enable individuals to pool their resources as a group and to govern however they choose.

Chora Groups also enables groups to manage common land, community vouchers, and ecological claims and assets on multiple networks.
