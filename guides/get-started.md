# Get Started

## Keplr

You will need to install [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/download) as a mobile application and/or a browser extension, depending on how you intend to interact with Chora applications. Keplr is a wallet application that enables users to interact with multiple blockchain networks in the [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) ecosystem. Chora applications use Keplr to easily interact with supported networks - i.e. Regen, Regen Redwood, and Chora Testnet.

## Tokens

You will need to have a small balance of tokens available in your account for each network you intend to interact with. These tokens will be required to pay for transactions fees. If you are new to blockchain, we recommend starting out with test networks to familiarize yourself with how this all works.

You can use the [Chora Faucet](https://faucet.chora.io/chora-testnet-1) to receive test network tokens from supported test networks. A small amount of tokens can be requested up to three times with the same account on each test network - i.e. Regen Redwood and Chora Testnet. After requesting tokens, you can verify that your account balance was updated with Keplr Wallet. You can also see your account balance in [Chora Ledger](https://ledger.chora.io/chora-testnet-1/account).
