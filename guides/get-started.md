# Get Started

## Keplr

You will need to install [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/download) as a mobile application and/or a browser extension, depending on how you intend to interact with the applications. Keplr is a wallet application that enables users to interact with multiple blockchain networks in the [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) ecosystem.

## Tokens

You will need to have a small balance of tokens available in your account for each network you intend to interact with. These tokens will be required to pay for transactions fees. If you are new to blockchain, we recommend starting with test networks to familiarize yourself with how this all works.

You can use the [Chora Faucet](https://faucet.chora.io/chora-testnet-1) to receive test network tokens from supported test networks. A small amount of tokens can be requested up to three times with the same account. After requesting tokens, check your account balance in Keplr Wallet or in the [Chora Ledger](https://ledger.chora.io/chora-testnet-1/account) application.
