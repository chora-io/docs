# Get Started

## Keplr

You will need to install [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/download) as a mobile application or browser extension. Keplr is a wallet application that enables you to interact with blockchain networks.

## Tokens

You will need to have tokens available in your account for each network you intend to interact with. If you are new to blockchain, we recommend starting with test networks.

You can use the [Chora Faucet](https://chora.io/faucet) to receive test network tokens from supported test networks. A small amount of tokens can be requested up to three times with the same account.
