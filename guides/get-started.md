# Get Started

## Keplr

You will need to install [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/download) as a mobile application and/or a browser extension depending on how you intend to interact with Chora applications (i.e. mobile or desktop).

Keplr is a wallet application that enables users to interact with multiple blockchain networks. All Chora applications use Keplr to connect users to supported networks (i.e. Regen, Regen Redwood, and Chora Testnet), enabling users to then sign and broadcast blockchain transactions.

## Tokens

You will need tokens for each network you intend to interact with. Tokens cover fees required for each transaction. If you are new to blockchain or managing a cryptographic key pair, we recommend starting with test networks to familiarize yourself with how this all works.

You can use the [Chora Faucet](https://faucet.chora.io/chora-testnet-1) application to receive tokens from supported test networks. A small amount of tokens can be requested up to three times with the same account on each test network (i.e. Regen Redwood and Chora Testnet). After requesting tokens, you can verify your account balance was updated by opening Keplr Wallet or the [Chora Ledger](https://ledger.chora.io/chora-testnet-1/account) application.
