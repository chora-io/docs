# Introduction

The [group](https://chora.io/group) demo application provides a simple user interface that enables the creation of groups, the fundamental building blocks of DAOs within the chora framework.

## Overview

This guide will walk through the creation and management of a decentralized organization using the [group](https://chora.io/group) demo application. In this guide, you will learn about the following:

1. Creating groups
2. Creating decision policies
3. Submitting proposals
4. Voting on proposals
5. Executing proposals

## Prerequisites

### Keplr

You will need to have [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/download) installed as a browser extension on your desktop computer.

### Account

You will need to have a test account that you can use with `chora-testnet-1`. This account should not be generated from the same mnemonic or private key as an account that holds any tokens of real value or has any sensitive permissions on another network.

### Tokens

You will need to have testnet tokens available in your test account. You can use the [testnet faucet](https://chora.io/faucet) to receive tokens. The faucet only works if your balance is less than the distribution amount. You can request tokens from the faucet up to three times within a 24-hour period.
