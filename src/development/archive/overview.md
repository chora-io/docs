# Overview

In order to demonstrate communication between blockchains, we will first be testing communication between two instances of `chora-chain`, and then between `chora-chain` and `regen-ledger`, both making use of the `ibc` module built within the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

After we have demonstrated communication between blockchains, we will be testing the minting of "eco credits" using the `ecocredit` module built within `regen-ledger` followed by the purchasing of vouchers for locked "eco credits" using the `ecodex` module built within `chora-chain`.
