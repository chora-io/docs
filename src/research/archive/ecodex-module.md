## Specification

This specifies an `ecodex` module that enables the exchange of eco credits between Cosmos-based blockchains. The eco credits exchanged on other blockchains are represented as vouchers for locked eco credits on `regen-ledger`. This enables other blockchains to create wrapped assets such as NFTs with vouchers for locked eco credit backed by ecological data on `regen-ledger`.
