# coop

## introduction

The "chora" project is a research project - we are not an official cooperative. We are researching software for decentralized asset management within a cooperative governance model.

We are researching cooperative governance models on two levels:

(1) a cooperative governance model that would serve the needs of our own research team and/or future community, designed to support ongoing research and development of the project

(2) a cooperative governance model that would serve the needs of small farmers and rural farming communities, displaced individuals and communities, or others who do not have access to the same resources and technologies
