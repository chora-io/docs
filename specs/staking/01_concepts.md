## Authority

The authority is the account that has permissions to update module parameters.

## Staking

Staking is the act of locking tokens up in the network. The `staking` module enables staking with the network or staking with validators and/or governors.

## Rewards

Rewards are granted to accounts that are staking based on the amount they are staking.
