# Concepts

## Authority

The authority is the account that has permissions to update module parameters.

## Validator

A validator is an author and validator of blocks.

## Delegator

A delegator is any account that delegates voting power to a validator. To delegate voting power, a delegator must lock tokens up with a validator. A delegator may earn rewards depending on module parameters and validator commission. A delegator always has the option to vote independently, cancelling out their delegated votes.
