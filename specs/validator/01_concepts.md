# Concepts

## Admin

The admin is the account that has permission to update module parameters. Module parameters define the settings of the module. The same account commonly configured as the admin for all modules within a blockchain application, in which case the admin is "the network admin" (see [admin](../admin/)).

## Validator

A validator is responsible for producing and verifying blocks by running the blockchain application. A validator can be "active" or "inactive" depending on the criteria defined by the module parameters and the status of the node running the application. An "active" validator is a validator that has an active node and the status of the validator meets the criteria defined by the module parameters.

## Validator Operator

An account that registers a validator becomes the operator of the validator.
