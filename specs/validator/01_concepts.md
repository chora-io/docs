# Concepts

## Authority

The authority account is the account that has permission to update module parameters. Module parameters define the settings of the module. The authority account is most commonly a module account that programmatically manages governance processes defined by other modules.

## Validator

A validator is an author and validator of blocks.

## Delegator

A delegator is any account that delegates voting power to a validator. To delegate voting power, a delegator must lock tokens up with a validator. A delegator may earn rewards depending on module parameters and validator commission. A delegator always has the option to vote independently, cancelling out their delegated votes.
