## Admin

The network admin is an account that has permission to update module parameters. Only the current admin account has permission to update the admin account.

The network admin can be any account, i.e. a module account, a group account, a multi-sig account, or an individual user account. For example, the network admin could be a module account managed by a module that implements proof-of-stake, or the network admin could be a group account that defines its own governance processes and as a result implements proof-of-authority.
