# Concepts

## Authority

The authority is the account that has permissions to update module parameters.

## Governor

A governor is elected through network governance. A governor acts as a representative of the network, receiving delegations and optionally charging commission.

## Delegator

A delegator is any account that delegates any amount of voting power to a governor. A delegator always has the option to vote independently, cancelling out their delegated votes.
