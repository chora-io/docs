# Concepts

## Authority

The authority is the account that has permissions to update module parameters.

## Governor

A governor is elected through network governance. A governor acts as a representative of the network, receiving delegations and optionally charging commission.

## Delegator

A delegator is any account that delegates voting power to a governor. To delegate voting power, a delegator must lock tokens up with a governor. A delegator may earn rewards depending on module parameters and governor commission. A delegator always has the option to vote independently, cancelling out their delegated votes.
