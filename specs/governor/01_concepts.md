## Admin

The admin is the account that has permission to update module parameters. Module parameters define the settings of the module. The same account is often configured as the admin for all modules within a blockchain application, in which case the admin is "the network admin" (see [admin](../admin/01_concepts.html#admin)).

## Governor

A governor is elected through network governance. A governor acts as a representative of the network, receiving delegations and optionally charging commission.

## Delegator

A delegator is any account that delegates voting power to a governor. To delegate voting power, a delegator must lock tokens up with a governor. A delegator may earn rewards depending on module parameters and governor commission. A delegator always has the option to vote independently, cancelling out their delegated votes.
