## Authority Account

The authority of the network is an account that has permission to update module parameters. Only the current authority account has permission to update the authority account.

The authority account can be any account, i.e. a module account, a group account, a multi-sig account, or an individual user account. For example, the authority account can be an account managed by a module that implements proof-of-stake or a group account that implements proof-of-authority.
